# linux-scavenger-hunt #

This is a scavenger hunt to learn Linux commands. Our goal is to find all
the clues and learn how to use basic Linux commands in the process.

############## IMPORTANT: RECORDING YOUR COMMANDS ##############


In order to get credit for doing the assignment, let's record our commands!

Before you run *anything*, run `start-record`. You should now see `[rec]` at
the start of every line, indicating everything is recorded!
If you get command not found, run `vm-update` first.

When you are done, run `exit`.

## Setup ##

First, choose a secret number with at least 4 digits. Don't forget it and
don't choose the same one as anyone else! The secret number makes your clues
unique, so other teams can't look over your shoulder.

Then type:

    python generate_clues.py [secret number]

Any time we enclose something in square brackets, you need to replace it
with an actual value (called an argument). For example, to get started I
might type:

    python generate_clues.py 1919

This will create a subdirectory called `clues`. Be sure to keep this file
(called the README) open in a separate viewer.

## Reference ##

### Clue 1: The Hunt Begins ###

#### `man` ####

The first command we are going to learn is `man`, which is short for manual.
Typing `man [command]` will give you a help page (usually called a manpage)
for most commands.

#### `ls` ####

The next command we need to learn is `ls` (list). Type `man ls` and read the
description before the list of options - you can ignore everything else for now.
Press `q` to exit. Then type `ls` and you should see something
like this:

    APPENDIX.md clues generate_clues.py LICENSE.md next_clue.py README.md

Items which are blue are directories (aka folders!) and everything else is a file. Any time
you need to know which files and directories are available, type `ls`!

#### `cd` ####

We need a couple more tools before we can start clue hunting. To change to
another directory (or folder) we use `cd` (change directory). You may notice that
`man cd` doesn't work. Sometimes, there is no manpage for a command. In that
case google is your friend. Going into a directory (or folder) is pretty simple:

    cd clues

This puts us in the clues directory (folder). To exit a directory (folder), we can do this:

    cd ..

If you ever get lost, just do

    cd ~/linux-scavenger-hunt

to return home. If you `cd` to the `clues` directory and do an `ls`, you
will notice that there are a lot of directories (folders), each numbered 00001-99999.
Most of them contain fake clues. Throughout our hunt we will be looking for real clues. Using
`cd`, navigate into the `clues` directory and then the `12345` directory, and type `ls` to list 
the files in this directory. You should see a single file named `clue`.

#### `cat` ####

Finally we need to be able to look at our clues. We can do this by doing:

    cat clue

This displays the conte of the file `clue` in your terminal. From now on, everything we need
will be contained in these clue files. It's a good idea to keep track of
all the clue numbers (like `12345`) somewhere, such as on a piece of paper
or in a digital note somewhere. Read clue `12345` to continue!
